# Meauxbility - GitHub Pages Development Site

This is a safe development/staging environment for meauxbility.org.

## URL
https://samprimeaux.github.io/meauxbility/

## Contents
- `index.html` - Homepage with header
- `assets/` - React app bundle and styles

## Deployment
Files are automatically served from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes locally
2. Test on this GitHub Pages site
3. Once verified, deploy to production (meauxbility.org)

This prevents breaking the live production site during development.
